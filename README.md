My name is Clay, this project contains my labs for CS145: Java and data structures.

WordSearch_CPP is programmed in C++ and uses recursion to create a grid of overlapping words for a word search. The proccess of overlapping the words is very thourough and the most complicated program I have made in this class but does suffer from performance issues as the complexity is factorial.

PhoneBook_C is programmed in C and implemnts linked lists and free and malloc for memory managment.

For Critters we where given most of the code and where assigned to make a single critter for the existing game. My critter, located in Sheep.java, accesses protected data in the main game and manipulates it to win instantly. It can also be used in a typical fashion.
